        <h1 class="display-6">Hello, my name is Ana Marija Šnajder and this is my vision of a recruitment process...
        </h1>
        <div class="aboutself">My first step in recruitment process would always be job analysis and job description, so
            I can understand
            more in depth what kind of people we need and who would fit in our work culture. That I’d do by having a
            conversation with colleagues who already work in our office and who know best what their job consists of,
            but also who certainly know what kind of person they would like to have by their side after the recruitment
            is done. After I have finished that job description, and before the distribution of the advertisement, I
            would make sure everything is going according to the law, that this whole process is completely objective
            and that the job posting is inclusive as well as very clear to the reader. Additionally, it’s important to
            see if there’s someone within the company who would be a match for this position, especially if we are on a
            low budget. Then, after all this consideration, I’d start creating a job advertisement. After we have a
            concise and eye-catching advertisement, having in mind we are, of course, trying to spend as little money as
            possible during this, I would start distributing job posting on social media, trying to find free or
            affordable solutions, like posting in specific Facebook groups, making an job ad on LinkedIn, finding out
            which applications could serve us (for example, app “Ding” appeared in Croatia fairly recently).
            Furthermore, I would ask colleagues in marketing department if they can spread our ad on our own social
            media platforms, e.g. on our Twitter, Google+ profile and so on. Except social media, I would try contacting
            educational institutions, in the field of interest, and ask them if they can post our job advertisement on
            their official pages, since
            it’s, in a way, for our mutual benefit; naturally, provided that it is possible to employ students in the
            required position. Referrals are, as well, cost beneficial way of getting in touch with potential
            candidates. I would ask current staff if they, perhaps, had a potential applicant in their minds, and,
            maybe, offer them compensation for their effort if the person who they suggested ended up joining our team.
